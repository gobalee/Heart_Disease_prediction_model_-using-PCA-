> The classification model used is RandomForestClassifier() </n>
> The categorical features are first converted to numbers with the help of pd.get_dummies()
> The features are then scaled using StandardScaler()
> The model trained on original dataset (without reducing the features) is ~90%
> Accuracy of model trained on reduced features is ~70%
